# Amazon_review_NLP

This is a project that webscrapes amazon for any product and breaks down all data into its respective clusters, further into respective sentences, and words.

Natural Language Toolkit was used to machine learn and cluster all data metrics down into its respective clusters for user feedback, with development to determine which comments are automated by bots.

SBERT python framework from https://www.sbert.net/ was used to allow a model to process the data.
